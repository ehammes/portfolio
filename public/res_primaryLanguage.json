      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elizabeth Hammes! I am studying to be a full stack software developer and I am currently focused on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have over 10 years of professional experience with roles in consulting, product management, and account management - primarily in ecommerce within the tech industry. Most recently I worked in customer success for an ecommerce SaaS startup managing 10 customers totaling about $2.5 million in annual recurring revenue. I've led B2B and B2C enterprise ecommerce implementations and managed discussions with stakeholders to capture business and technical requirements. I have experience working with development teams using agile methodologies and owned requirements to create user stories, plan development sprints,Â conduct testing, and provide sprint demos and training. I have a passion for technology to build superior products while providing best in class user experiences. I value hard work, attention to detail, team collaboration, and making data-driven decisions.",
